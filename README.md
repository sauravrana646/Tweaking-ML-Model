## Tweaking-ML-Model

This is a task to integrate Machine Learning with DevOPs.
Here what we do is that we run this code in a container and if we the accuracy of trained model is lesser than 95% our another code make some changes in this code (like add some more layers or increase the number of epochs) and again train the model automatically until the desired accuracy is reached.
